## Decision Tree

>Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model which maps observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning.

### Formula of Entropy :

> Entropy is the Measure of `Impurity` in Bunch of Samples.

> Formula: Sum([-P<sub>i</sub>]*log<sub>2</sub>(P<sub>i</sub>))
    where : P is the fraction of the examples in the sample

### Information Gain :

> I.G = entropy(parent) - [weighted average]*entropy(children)
